# Hotel Data Analytics Project Using Python

## AtliQ Grand Hotel

AtliQ Grand Hotel has a chain of hotels in 4 Indian cities: Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad. They offer various types of hotels and segments of rooms. Bookings occur either through AtliQ's own website or via third-party websites.

### Problem Statement

AtliQ Grand is facing severe challenges from its competitors and is losing market share and revenue. The management wants to implement data-informed decision-making to increase their revenue.

We will not perform the analysis on the Booking database (OLTP) as it may interfere with its operations. Using ETL, we will create a Data Warehouse (OLAP) to perform the analysis.
